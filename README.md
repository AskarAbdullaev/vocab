# Vocab

I am fond of learining languages and coding. Therefore, I usually try to combine them and create small tools for 

## Analyse_vocab

When trying to read a text in a foreign language, it is convenient to extract potentially interesting vocabulary.
Or even to do it before actually reading the source text.
This utility is designed to list possibly interesting tokens in the given context and within the given difficulty level.

Unfortunately, there are inherited issues with NLP (tokenization problems, lemmatization failures, limitation of the modules I rely on). Many of them can be adressed by extensive effort and I will try to solve them in the future.

Notice: it is designed for languages based on ascii symbols.
